  },
  {
    "question": "Why the colours of the button are different ?",
    "answer": "The button lights up in different colours and can blink differently in order to better understand what error or which process the machine is conducting. For flashing white light- the machine is heating up and when the white light is stable the coffee machine is ready to be used. When the button is pulsating white, please ensure that the machine is closed properly, and when closing the upper part make sure the closed lock symbol is used. The pulsating orange and white light implies the fact that the descaling process must be done as soon as possible; until the process is finished, the machine can still extract any assortment. When the machine displays the orange light without any blinking, the descaling process must be done immediately and the machine will not extract any more coffee. If the light is blinking orange, please make sure that a capsule is introduced and make sure the extraction head is not blocked. When the machine displays the blue color, please verify the bluetooth connection.If the LED shows a red alert, there can be several reasons, and also the light cadence of the device can vary, i.e. if the LED flashes red every 0.5 seconds, please check the water level in the tank. If the LED flashes white once and then red/orange twice, it is possible that the device does not recognise the assortment you have introduced, thus we would ask you to clear the device and update the software version of the device. When the LED of the espresso machine flashes twice quickly and then pauses, your device has encountered an electronic error, so please disconnect and reconnect the device to the power supply after 10 seconds, and if the problem persists please return to the factory settings. Should you want to rinse your machine please follow the instructions in this video or call our Specialists at 0800008300."

  },
  {
    "question": "There is no water coming out of the coffee outlet. What can I do?",
    "answer": "If you press a cup button and no water comes out of the spout, it is possible that the machine has an air bubble which most often occurs when the tank runs empty or after a period of non-use.\nFor the Essenza and Le Cube machine, simply lift the coffee lever and push it away from you. While applying pressure, press either cup button until water appears in the capsule chamber.\nCitiZ, Pixie, and Lattissima owners can fill the water tank, eject any capsule in the chamber, close the coffee lever and press either cup button. The auto-prime function will push the air from the circuit. When water begins to flow through the spout, the air bubble has been released. For owners of machines with steam functions, it is best to activate the steam/hot water function. The lower pressure this function operates with allows the air to be released with greater ease.\nYou are welcome to contact Nespresso Customer Service for further assistance on our free-phone number 0800 00 8300, from Monday to Friday, 08:00 - 20:00."
  },
  {
    "question": "The coffee is not hot enough in the cup, what could be the reason?",
    "answer": "The optimum temperature of the coffee at the coffee outlet is between 83-89 °C. It might be much colder in the cup, especially if the cup itself is cold, or if a short coffee is prepaper into a big cup. We advise to preheat the cup with hot water. The other possible reason is that the machine needs to be descaled."
